        "### Star Wars Chat Bot\n",
        "This project explores the development of a simple chatbot using PyTorch, capable of engaging in conversations related to the Star Wars universe. The chatbot utilizes a neural network model trained on a dataset of common Star Wars facts and responses. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, the chatbot is designed to recognize user input patterns and generate contextually relevant replies.\n",
        "The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how a generic chatbot can be created and trained on specific conversational data. The chatbot, although built with Star Wars-themed data, can easily be adapted to other domains with appropriate data formatting. This project serves as a foundational demonstration of artificial intelligence in conversational agents, highlighting the simplicity of building machine learning models capable of basic dialogue systems.\n",
        "This chatbot showcases not only the capabilities of neural networks in text classification but also the potential for expanding into more advanced conversational agents in the future."

To achieve this, we will implement custom functions that streamline the process of preparing the data.

For instance, “run,” “running,” and “ran” are variations of the same base word, “run.” This process of reducing a word to its base or root form is called Stemming. Stemming helps the model recognize these variations as the same word, thus improving the efficiency of the model. In this project, we'll use the Porter Stemmer from the NLTK library, which is one of the most commonly used stemming methods. You can find more information on stemming here.\n",

We create a list containing all unique words in the dataset and then represent each sentence as an array where each position corresponds to whether a word is present (1) or absent (0). For example, if we have a sentence like “how are you” and an array of words like [\"hi\", \"hello\", \"you\", \"how\", \"are\", \"goodbye\"], the Bag of Words representation would look like [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0].\n",

In contrast to other neural networks, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), FFNNs do not have loops or cycles in their architecture. This structure ensures that the data moves forward in the network without feedback loops. Feedforward networks are widely used in many tasks, such as image classification and natural language processing, and are particularly known for their ease of implementation.

Without activation functions, neural networks would behave like a simple linear transformation and would not be capable of solving problems that require complex, non-linear decision boundaries. You can explore activation functions further here.\n",

The Cross Entropy loss function measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual labels (ground truth). It helps guide the model by penalizing predictions that deviate from the true label, thus minimizing the overall error during training. In PyTorch, we can use nn.CrossEntropyLoss() to apply this loss function. More details on Cross Entropy can be found here.\n",

        "Optimizer: Adam Optimizer\n",
        "To update the model’s weights during training, we will use the Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) Optimizer. Adam is an efficient and widely used optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of both AdaGrad (which works well with sparse gradients) and RMSProp (which handles non-stationary objectives). Adam dynamically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on estimates of first and second moments of the gradients, making it suitable for large datasets and deep neural networks. In PyTorch, we can initialize the Adam optimizer using torch.optim.Adam(). You can read more about Adam here."

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
